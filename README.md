# Student Loan Repayment Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of student loan repayment. Using historical data on student loans, the model aims to assist lenders in determining appropriate interest rates based on the predicted repayment probability.

## Methods Used
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was first cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Model Development**: We utilized a deep learning model, specifically a neural network, to predict loan repayment. The model structure included several dense layers with ReLU activation for hidden layers and a sigmoid activation for the output layer to perform binary classification.
- **Training and Validation**: The model was trained on a split dataset, using 80% of the data for training and 20% for validation to ensure the model generalizes well on unseen data.

## Libraries Required
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

These libraries can be installed via pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow keras

## Development Environment
- **Google Colab**: The project was developed in Google Colab, which provided a robust cloud-based environment that allowed for the utilization of free GPU access, enhancing the training speed of our deep learning models.
- **Features of Colab**: The autocompletion feature in Google Colab was particularly useful, offering intuitive coding assistance that helped speed up the development process and reduce syntactic errors.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Open Google Colab and upload the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Ensure all the necessary libraries are installed.
3. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Conclusion
The deep learning model showed promising results in predicting the likelihood of student loan repayments. The predictive accuracy and insights gained from this model can significantly aid financial institutions in making informed decisions.
